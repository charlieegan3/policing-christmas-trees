# Policing Christmas Trees

A wise man once said: "Safe, organised fun is the best kind of fun -
_especially_ when Christmas trees are involved."

This project was prepared as a demo of [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org)
for the 2019 _Christmas_ Show & Tell of the
[London Computation Club](https://london.computation.club).

While this is a really dumb idea for a project; I've found it helpful to apply a
'work thing' in a completely different (if fictional) domain.

You can view a demo of the project at
